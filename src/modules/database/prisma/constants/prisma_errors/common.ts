   * - Argument `{}` is missing in generator block `{}`.
   * - Error parsing attribute `@{}`: `{}`
   * - Attribute `@{}` is defined twice.

   * - `{}` is a reserved scalar type name and can not be used.
   * - The `{}` `{}` cannot be defined because a `{}` with that name already exists.
   * - Key `{}` is already defined in `{}`.
   * - Argument `{}` is already specified as unnamed argument.
   * - Argument `{}` is already specified.
   * - No such argument.
   * - Field `{}` is already defined on model `{}`.
   * - Field `{}` in model `{}` can't be a list. The current connector does not support lists of primitive types.

   * - Attribute not known: `@{}`.
   * - Function not known: `{}`.
   * - Datasource provider not known: `{}`.

   * - Type `{}` is neither a built-in type, nor refers to another model, custom type, or enum.
   * - Type `{}` is not a built-in type.
   * - Unexpected token. Expected one of: `{}`
   * - Environment variable not found: `{}`.
   * - Expected a `{}` value, but received `{}` value `{}`.
   * - Expected a `{}` value, but failed while parsing `{}`: `{}`.
   * - Error validating model `{}`: `{}`
   * - Error validating field `{}` in model `{}`: `{}`
